# <p id="about">About</p>

This app works as a daemon and periodically fetches the data about switch games then shows desktop
notification if any of the predefined games is on sale or have price below set limit.

It's rather for my own use but if you find it useful you can do things with it.

# <p id="installation">Installation</p>

Currently only Linux is supported.
- go to [releases](https://github.com/devzbysiu/je/releases) page
- download the latest `sweetch-bot` archive
- extract it
- run `sweetch-bot`

### Location
`sweetch-bot` expects that configuration is in OS' configuration path.
| Platform | Value                                                  | Example                                                   |
| -------  | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |

# List of watched games below

[[watched_game]]
title = "Minecraft Dungeons"      # By default, if this game is on sale, it will be
                                  # included in notification. You can use price 
                                  # criterion - see below.

[[watched_game]]
title = "DOOM"
acceptable_price = 7.00           # If this game has price <= acceptable_price, then
                                  # it will be included in the notification.

[[watched_game]]
title = "Alien: Isolation"
